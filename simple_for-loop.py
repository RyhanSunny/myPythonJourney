# Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza . Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a
# for loop to print the name of each pizza .• Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza
# instead of printing just the name of the pizza . For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a
# simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza .• Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop,
# that states how much you like pizza . The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza you
# like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!

# >>>
pizzas = ['marinara', 'mozzarella', 'mushrooms', 'Pepperoni Pie']

for pizza in pizzas:
    print('Everyday is Pizza Day and Today We Want {}'.format(pizza))

print('\nAs you might have noticed by now, we love pizza')
